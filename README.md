# Kupo-s-Files
# This is all of the relevent files that control the server, if you think there is a mod you want, you can use the fork system through github to request new changes to the mods or configurations if you feel there is something that should be different. If it works I will commit it.
# Ensure you sync your github before you run minecraft if you know about a change or you may get conflict errors when joining.
