#Kupo-s-Files

+This is all of the relevent files that control the server, if you think there is a mod you want, you can use the fork system through github to request new changes to the mods or configurations if you feel there is something that should be different. If it works I will commit it.

+When syncing the files, go to your root directory by going into FTB Launcher, open "Edit Mod Pack" and click "open folder" from there go up the folder tree til you are in the Direwolf17-10 folder. Delete the folders "Mods" and "Configs" and *COPY* the files from your github folder (Mods and Config folder) to the Direwolf folder.

+Ensure you sync your github before you run Minecraft if you know about a change or you may get conflict errors when joining.
